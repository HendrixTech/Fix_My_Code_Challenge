#Fix My Code Challenge 

For this project, I was exposed to diverse programming languages.
I workrd with the C Programming language, Python, JavaScript and ruby e.t.c.

This is a new type of project, where we'll jump into an existing code base and fix it.
Nothing as powerful as fixing the bugs of other people code.

I have used pre-written repos as initial files for all solutions.
I am not coding anything new, just fixing the existing code base.
